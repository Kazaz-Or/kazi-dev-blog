## About Me

My name is Or Kazaz and I live in Israel.

I'm a Software/Automation Developer, a husband and a proud father of two wonderful kids.

I'm passionate about Python, Javascript, NodeJS, Linux, Automation, Infrastructure, Backend Development & Testing.

### Background
From a very young age, my interest in computers started with creating simple websites using HTML and JS, and of course - Gaming.

However, after I turned 18 I joined the Army and spent 4 years there. Following that, I obtained a Degree (not in CS or SW related), and then worked in the Media & Press industry for nearly 4 years.

At some point, I realized that I wanted to explore my passion for computers further. I became a QA Engineer after graduating from an ISTQB course, as I felt my career needed a significant change that would challenge me. I grew every day, learned a lot, made lots of friends, met some great colleagues, and progressed into managerial roles such as Team Lead & and eventually as a QA Manager within a span of around six years.

Once I started the managerial role of a QA manager (similar to a Group Manager in the software development world), it took me around two months to realize that i'm not ready to let go of the opportunity to try and become a software developer.

Fortunately, I was lucky enough to have a previous manager and good friend recognize my passion for software development and offer me a role as an Automation Developer. The team I joined consisted of close teammates who had worked with me previously, which made for a smooth transition and reduced my stress levels.

I think i've written enough on this subject - You can find my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kazaz-or/) for more details about my previous/current roles.


### Continuous Learning
To prepare for my transition into Automation, I took on a personal challenge of [100 Days of Code in Python](https://github.com/Kazaz-Or/100DaysOfCode-Python). Although I had some prior experience with the language, I felt that it was important to learn the fundamentals and build on my knowledge from there.

During this challenge, I quickly realized that there was so much more to learn, which is true for every day in software development. This brought to mind a saying from my QA days: "a day that you didn't learn anything isn't a good day." This motto embodies the attitude of continuous learning, which is essential in the ever-evolving world of software development.

To maintain this mindset, I try to challenge myself with tasks at work, [tutorials](https://github.com/Kazaz-Or/automation-projects), podcasts, books, [personal projects](https://github.com/Kazaz-Or/projects-and-scripts), and continually seek to expand my knowledge and skills. This is what makes the software industry so exciting for me, and to be honest - This is one of the reasons this blog was created.

### So Why Blogging ?

Although blogging isn't typically my style, I find it to be a form of personal therapy and a useful journal, even if it primarily contains technical content. 

I want to emphasize that I am not an expert and everything I share on this blog is based on my own experiences and challenges. I do not claim that my methods are the best or the only way to approach a problem, so I welcome any feedback or suggestions on my posts.

In my blog, I plan to write about challenging day-to-day tasks, new things I have learned, and other topics that I find personally interesting or relevant. 
While some of these posts may seem trivial to others, they were not trivial to me when I wrote them, and I hope that they can be helpful to others.

I decided to start this blog for two primary reasons - 

The first one is somewhat selfish - Writing about something that I have worked on, regardless of its size or complexity, helps me to understand it on a deeper level.

Secondly, many individuals commenced their careers in the QA world and might looking to develop in their careers. If I can inspire someone in the same way that some of my previous managers inspired me, it would mean a great deal to me.
